# PostPilot

PostPilot is a simple Vercel webapp for uploading a creative, previewing Malay copywriting, and publishing it directly to a Facebook Page after approval.

Copywriting is generated from the uploaded creative note plus the supplied salespage URL. The app fetches the salespage title, meta description, headings, and visible text snippets so it is not locked to one product.

The posting flow is:

1. Upload creative and salespage URL.
2. Preview caption and first comment CTA.
3. Approve to publish, or regenerate for a new copywriting variation.

## Required Vercel Environment Variables

Set these in Vercel Project Settings:

```text
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID=1201743546357100
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_page_access_token
APP_PASSWORD=strong_login_password
```

Optional:

```text
MAX_UPLOAD_MB=20
```

## Invoice PDF + Google Drive

The app also includes a monthly ads invoice generator. It auto-detects the current month, creates one PDF per configured client, lets you review each PDF, then uploads approved invoices into each client's Google Drive `Invoice & Receipt` subfolder.

## Vercel Deploy / Repair CLI

This project uses one Vercel serverless function at `api/app.js`. The actual route handlers live in `api_handlers/`, and `vercel.json` rewrites each API path to `api/app.js?route=...`. This keeps the Hobby plan under the 12-function deployment limit.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run ip -- check
npm run ip -- link
npm run ip -- pull
npm run ip -- build
npm run ip -- deploy
npm run ip -- db:setup
npm run ip -- db:migrate
npm run ip -- env
npm run ip -- env:add APP_PASSWORD production
npm run ip -- repair
```

`npm run ip -- repair` links to the `invoice-pilot` Vercel project, pulls production settings, checks syntax, builds, and deploys production.

Set `VERCEL_PROJECT=your-project-name` if you need to target a different Vercel project.

### Invoice Environment Variables

```text
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/google/oauth-callback
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=refresh_token_from_oauth_setup

```

### Supabase Database

Client data, editable business settings, and invoice upload history are stored in Supabase when `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set. Google Drive is still used for client folders and PDF files.

Create the database tables first:

```bash
npm run supabase:setup
```

`supabase:setup` runs `supabase/schema.sql` when `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is available. If not, open Supabase SQL Editor and paste the SQL from `supabase/schema.sql`.

Required Supabase env:

```text
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

Optional setup env for local schema creation:

```text
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db.project-ref.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

To import old Drive JSON data into Supabase:

```bash
npm run supabase:migrate-drive
```

Clients are seeded from `lib/invoice-config.js` as fallback defaults. The current default client list is:

- TEEGA
- SAFRICH
- MUIZ NAZMI (HONDA)
- KAK SUE KITCHEN
- AZ HUSTLER EMPIRE

The app uses `INVOICE_DRIVE_MASTER_FOLDER_ID` as the master client folder. New clients added from the app are stored in Supabase, and Google Drive folders are created automatically:

- `LBM x {brand client}`
- `Weekly Report`
- `Invoice & Receipt`

Invoice uploads go into `Invoice & Receipt`. Each successful upload is recorded in the Supabase `invoice_uploads` table.

The Settings tab stores the business profile used in invoice PDFs in Supabase. If Supabase is not configured yet, invoice PDFs fall back to the environment variables above.

You can also override all clients from Vercel with `INVOICE_CLIENTS_JSON`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Client Name",
    "code": "CLIENT",
    "billingName": "Client Sdn Bhd",
    "billingAddress": "Client billing address",
    "monthlyRetainer": 1500,
    "driveFolderName": "LBM x Client Name"
  }
]
```

To get `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, login to the app and open:

```text
/api/google/oauth-start
```

After approving Google access, copy the refresh token shown on the callback page into Vercel env.

## Local Facebook Workflow

The original local automation and Telegram workflow is kept under `facebook-posts/`.

## App Icons

The web, iOS, and Android app icons are generated from `public/logo.svg`:

- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png`
- `public/icons/android-chrome-192x192.png`
- `public/icons/android-chrome-512x512.png`
